# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Classification

</div>

## Project Overview
This project is an Email Spam Classifier built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and multiple machine learning algorithms. It aims to accurately classify incoming email messages into "Spam" or "Not Spam" (Ham) categories based on their content. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and deployment using a web app interface.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing including tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming.
- Visualization through plots and word clouds to explore spam vs ham email characteristics.
- Multiple classification algorithms including Naive Bayes variants, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and more.
- Evaluation using accuracy and precision metrics.
- Deployment-ready Streamlit web app for real-time spam detection.

## Usage

### Running the notebook
Open `notebooks/EDA_and_Modeling.py` to explore data insights and train models interactively.

### Training and saving model
Use the functions in `src/model.py` to train your model and save the model and vectorizer for deployment.

### Launching the web app
Run the Streamlit application to classify emails in real time:
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```
Enter an email message in the text area and click "Predict" to see if it is spam or not.
